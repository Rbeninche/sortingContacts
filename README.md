Write a sort_contacts function that takes a dictionary of contacts as a parameter and returns a sorted list of those contacts, where each contact is a tuple.

The contacts dictionary that will be passed into the function has the contact name as its key, and the value is a tuple containing the phone number and email for the contact.
